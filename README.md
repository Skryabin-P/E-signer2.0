# E-signer GUI 

This program was written for organisation I am working as system administrator. 
It posts digital signs in .pfx on pdf files automatically.
You just need to pick up your .pfx certificate, type your password and choose a folder where you want 
to store your signed file.

### It has 2 modes:
- Sign PDF
- Sign Excel (converts to a pdf via pywin32, so it's need to be Excel installed)

Sign places at the left bottom corner of a document

This program helps our employees to focus on their job, not bureaucracy

### Also
 It can easily  be transformed to .exe with pyinstaller lib
